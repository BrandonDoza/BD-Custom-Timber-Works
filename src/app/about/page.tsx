          At BD Custom Timber Works, we&rsquo;re passionate about creating
          exceptional, handcrafted wood pieces that elevate any space. Founded
          by Brandon, a woodworking enthusiast based in the heart of Arvada,
          Colorado, our company is driven by a love for the outdoors and the
          beauty of the mountains that surround us. When Brandon isn&rsquo;t in
          the workshop, you&rsquo;ll find him mountain biking, exploring nature
          with his two dogs, or spending quality time with his wife. We bring
          that same dedication and care into every project, whether it&rsquo;s
          custom furniture, charcuterie boards, or unique woodworking solutions.
          At BD Custom Timber Works, we don&rsquo;t just build furnitureâ€”we
          craft pieces that tell a story and become a part of your home.
